# PrioritizeRoutes
## Prioritize your routes in Laravel 5.
<!-- header end -->

PrioritizeRoutes is a Laravel 5.1 and up package that allows you to assign priority to routes.

Prioritizing routes can be very useful when you want to ensure a catchall route is always matched last, allowing other routes that also match this catchall route to match first. More info in the [Documentation](http://prioritize-routes.cupoftea.io/docs/).
